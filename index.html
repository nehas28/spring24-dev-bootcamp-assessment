                    with a focus in Intel-IxD. She loves UI/UX design as well as front-end development
                    and would like to broaden her skills to full-stack development. During high school 
                    she organized a recycling drive in her neighborhood to advise people in her community
                    on how to properly dispose of glass. She also taught a series of Origami classes to children 
                    in the US to raise funding that provided scholarships to children and students in India and Africa. 
                    She also plays the piano, fences, and loves spending time in nature.
